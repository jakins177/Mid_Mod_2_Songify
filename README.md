This react app uses the spotify web API to pull featured playlists. The app displays the playlists images which a user can click on. Then the user will see the list of song names and album image. A user can than click on the title or album image to hear a 30 second preview of that song. The react context API is used. 

Some things I can do is make a grid display, and make a song details page. 

A hosted version of this app is here:
